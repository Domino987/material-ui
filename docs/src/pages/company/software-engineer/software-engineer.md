# Software Engineer

<p class="description">We are looking for a software engineer to help support our open source team, assist the Material-UI community and grow our premium products. Join us in our mission to make web application development simple.</p>

## About Us

Material-UI is a community and developer focused team that makes it easy to build amazing user interfaces, for any device, with React.

Our core values include transparency (our work is public most of the time); creating a safe, high-trust team; building incredible developer experiences; maintaining a healthy working environment; and helping to deliver web experiences that feel amazing to use on every device and connection type.

Material-UI started back in 2015 to unify React and Material Design. Today, Material-UI has grown to become one of the world's most popular React UI libraries – backed by a vibrant community of more than 1M developers in over 180 countries.

## Details of the Role

- Type of Work: Full-time employee
- Start date: immediately
- Location: Paris 16e or remote (preference for UTC-5 to UTC+3)

## Why we’re hiring

Both our open source products / community and our premium products are [growing fast](https://www.rank2traffic.com/material-ui.com) and we need talented engineers to keep that going!

We need help improving the health of Material-UI open source: make the library easier to use, make it support more use cases, improve performance, make it more accessible, make it easier to customize. We also need help keeping up with the community, guiding developers to answers, and just generally being a positive presence in the open source community.

We also need to develop our premium content. We have a premium themes and templates marketplace, and soon premium components bundled under a Material-UI Pro offering.

## Why this is interesting

Our solution is empowering React developers to build awesome applications. It should be easy, it shouldn’t require any advanced technical skills. Hundreds of thousands of developers use Material-UI every month. Let’s reach the full potential.

Our premium products portfolio is still small, with a million interesting and challenging problems to solve.

## What you’ll do on a day-to-day basis

Depending on the day, you’ll:

On the open source side (50% of the time):

- **Help guide architectural decisions** (5%). From modernizing the way we handle styles to build new components, the future of Material-UI is discussed and planned in our public RFCs and issues. You’ll be helping drive these conversations and guiding Material-UI toward the best possible solutions.
- **Contribute to deep, meaningful refactors and feature releases** (15%). Material-UI is a complex codebase. Meaningful features we’ve shipped recently, like a Tree View component, Slider component, they have often required a couple weeks to a month of dedicated, careful work.
- **Reduce friction** (10%). A large amount of the work of Material-UI is reducing friction and making it easier to use. This might involve careful API design, identifying and fixing top bugs, creating easier-to-use error messages, and writing documentation and blog posts about features you ship.
- **Collaborate with the community** (10%). Many small as well as meaningful fixes and features have been contributed by the community. Your role as a core team maintainer is to draw the best out of the community — to inspire those across the world to create and contribute through your reviews of their issues and pull requests.
- **Experiment and play** (10%). Great, unexpected features and heisenbug fixes on the team have come from a number of sources — relentlessly methodical processes of elimination, free-flowing team collaboration, inspiration by adjacent libraries and projects, and difficult-to-explain individual strokes of brilliance. Whatever your preferred style is for creating new things that others might not have thought of, you’ll find a welcome home on the team.

On the premium side (50% of the time):

- **Take ownership of features from idea/mockup to live deployment**. You’ll shape and guide the direction of crucial new features, including new components.
- **Ship. Early and often**. You’ll iterate and ship frequently. You’ll have a real impact on the end-user experience and you’ll love working on a team that builds stunning UIs and prioritizes delivering real user value as often as possible.

## Experience you should have

- **Expertise in the modern JavaScript ecosystem**. Material-UI is built on the shoulders of giants, making use of technologies like ES2015+, TypeScript, Node.js, React, Next.js, webpack, and Babel.
- **A track record demonstrating an eye for design and solving real world user problems**. If you have a knack for shipping beautiful, intuitive software, we want you on our team.
- **Experience building and shipping production code in a team setting** with a passion for writing tested, performant, and high-quality code.
- **Strong written and verbal communication skills**. As part of our open source team, you’d interface both directly and indirectly with community members, and contribute to user documentation. Clear communication is fundamental in creating intuitive and compelling resources.
- **Ability to dive into complex problems**. You should be able to quickly assess, understand, and iterate upon aspects of our codebase.
- **Ready and willing to ask and answer questions**. If you’re comfortable saying you’re unsure, asking for help, and reaching out to assist others, you’ll be an incredible addition to our team. Our team thrives because of continuous learning. First time mistakes should be celebrated, not blamed.
- **Avoid monolithic deliverables**. You scope and stage your work into well-defined milestones to ship.
- **Past work with frontend infrastructure**. Perhaps you’ve created your company’s design system, written a babel plugin, or written complex React components. It would be great if you could address this in your cover letter!

## Experience it would be nice if you had, but isn’t required

- **You’ve maintained an active repository before**. Maybe you’ve helped maintain a popular open source repo, or maybe you’ve worked on internal repos that saw contributions from multiple teams. Previous experience with highly active repo workflows is a definite plus for this role.
- **You have used Material-UI before**. You have built a non trivial application with Material-UI in the past. You know the limitations of the library, you know a few areas that could be improved.
- **You have contributed code to Material-UI before**. A history of contributing to Material-UI would be a definite plus.

## The best parts of this job

- **You’ll be at the cutting edge of application development** — working on one of the fastest-growing UI frameworks on the market.
- **You’ll be part of an active, open, friendly community** of developers that are really excited about building awesome applications.
- **Your role will be key to making Material-UI the go to UI framework solution** for building applications and design systems with React.

## The worst parts of this job

- **Shifting context.** You may necessarily have to shift context and dive into a different feature before the current one is done. It may even be in an area of the code base you’re unfamiliar with or don’t have a ton of understanding about. It’s fun, rewarding work, but it can be very challenging.
- **We move quickly, but don’t sacrifice quality**. We ship. Early, often, and quickly. You may not be initially comfortable with the cadence with which we ship high-quality features and improvements to end users. By doing so, we give up on solving each problem at 100%. Solving 50-70% with quality should be enough for any given iteration. Our users manifest themselves, they quickly tell us when we don’t push a solution far enough.
- **Material-UI is a large codebase**. You may bang your head against the wall at times, and then write tests to assist future you.
The work you would be doing is somewhat unique and idiosyncratic. You probably have not had a similar role before.
- **In open source, you’re faced with a nonstop stream of bug reports and support requests**. That means you need to develop an intuition of when to ignore something and when to dig in further.

## Benefits for you

- A competitive package, including stock options.
- A great health insurance policy.
