# About Us

<p class="description">We’re on a mission to make web application development simple.</p>

Material-UI is a community and developer focused team that makes it easy to build amazing user interfaces, for any device, with React.

Our core values include transparency (our work is public most of the time); creating a safe, high-trust team; building incredible developer experiences; maintaining a healthy working environment; and helping to deliver web experiences that feel amazing to use on every device and connection type.

Material-UI started back in 2015 to unify React and Material Design. Today, Material-UI has grown to become one of the world's most popular React UI libraries – backed by a vibrant community of more than 1M developers in over 180 countries.
