# Example Projects

Are you looking for an example project to get started?

We host some example projects which you can find in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/material-next/material-next) under the [`/examples`](https://github.com/material-next/material-next/tree/master/examples) folder:
- [Create React App](https://github.com/material-next/material-next/tree/master/examples/create-react-app)
- [Next.js](https://github.com/material-next/material-next/tree/master/examples/nextjs)
- [Create React App with Flow](https://github.com/material-next/material-next/tree/master/examples/create-react-app-with-flow)
- [Create React App with TypeScript](https://github.com/material-next/material-next/tree/master/examples/create-react-app-with-typescript)

The source code for this documentation site is also included in the repository.
This is a slightly more complex project.
Check out the [`/docs`](https://github.com/material-next/material-next/tree/master/docs) folder for
build instructions.
