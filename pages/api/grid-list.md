# GridList API

<p class="description">The API documentation of the GridList React component. Learn more about the properties and the CSS customization points.</p>

```js
import GridList from '@material-ui/core/GridList';
```

Deprecated, use ImageList instead.

## Props

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:--------|:------------|

Any other properties supplied will be spread to the root element ([GridList](/api/grid-list/)).

## Inheritance

The properties of the [GridList](/api/grid-list/) component are also available.
You can take advantage of this behavior to [target nested components](/guides/api/#spread).
